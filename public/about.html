<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />

<p>I was born in Vietnam in 1987 and grew up, then I attended University of Technology in 2005. But later I quit and passed the exam to join Nanyang Technological University in Singapore in 2007. Juts that</p>

<p>My strength is Physics but I find it hard to get a job just with that skill</p>

I want to suggest anyone to:
<ul>
  <li>Try your best to archive your goal</li>
  <li>Don't be afraid of the difficulty and do not let it block you from growing up.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Keep going on! <br />
And keep going on <br />
